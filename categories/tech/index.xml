The incredible thing about it is that people have built all these amazing actions that you can use to build your CI system in a plug-and-play way! One of these actions that I&amp;rsquo;ve now integrated into this very blog is a hugo deployment action. It now deploys itself as soon as I make a change, which is fantastical!</description></item></channel></rss>
