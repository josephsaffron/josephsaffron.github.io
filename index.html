Sometimes, they&rsquo;re wrong. Sometimes the journey sucks and you just want to get to where you&rsquo;re going as fast as possible. That was the case for me and my friends last Wednesday, when we drove from Kitchener to Indianapolis for Gen Con, the biggest gaming convention in North America.
It all started when we split into two cars.</p><footer><a href=https://josephsaffron.github.io/blog/2023-08-02-gen-con-2023/ rel=full-article>Read On &rarr;</a></footer></article><article><header><p class=meta>Aug 1, 2023

You drive your car, and roll down your windows, and the people give you candy. The kids sat in the back with their windows rolled down, held open their bags, and got candy deposited in. Strangely, they also tried to hand candy to my wife. It took us awhile before we realised that they probably thought she was a kid!</p><footer><a href=https://josephsaffron.github.io/blog/2021-10-30-all-hallows/ rel=full-article>Read On &rarr;</a></footer></article><article><header><p class=meta>May 12, 2021

The incredible thing about it is that people have built all these amazing actions that you can use to build your CI system in a plug-and-play way! One of these actions that I&rsquo;ve now integrated into this very blog is a hugo deployment action. It now deploys itself as soon as I make a change, which is fantastical!</p><footer><a href=https://josephsaffron.github.io/blog/2021-05-12-blog-now-improved-but-also-completely-the-same/ rel=full-article>Read On &rarr;</a></footer></article><article><header><p class=meta>Apr 22, 2021

I decided to list them out and go through some of them in a bit of detail. What else is there to do during a global pandemic?
Comfort Food Malt and Barley One of our earliest local spots, it&rsquo;s remained one of our absolute favourites. Everything we&rsquo;ve tried there has been fantastic, and the portion sizes are great.</p><footer><a href=https://josephsaffron.github.io/blog/2021-04-22-best-places-weve-found-to-eat-in-kwc-takeout-edition/ rel=full-article>Read On &rarr;</a></footer></article><article><header><p class=meta>Jan 20, 2020

It was an interesting experience, to say the least. I had to think of things to keep them engaged, and I really felt when they made a connection. I also really felt when I had lost them completely - they all had phones. =/ For better or worse, my notes are below:</p><footer><a href=https://josephsaffron.github.io/blog/2020-01-20-take-your-grade-9s-to-work-and-give-them-a-presentation/ rel=full-article>Read On &rarr;</a></footer></article><article><header><p class=meta>Jun 24, 2019

The official scrum guide says that “the sprint retrospective is an opportunity for the team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next sprint”. If you’re just starting out with running retrospectives though, beginning your retrospectives with this goal can quickly devolve to finger pointing and complaining.</p><footer><a href=https://josephsaffron.github.io/blog/2019-06-24-ideas-for-running-retrospectives/ rel=full-article>Read On &rarr;</a></footer></article><article><header><p class=meta>Aug 2, 2018

The last time we went was in 2010, so it&rsquo;s been awhile, and a lot has changed! It would probably be best to start from the beginning of the trip though. We decided to leave on Tuesday afternoon so that we could get a day to relax before the conference, which ended up being a pretty good decision.</p><footer><a href=https://josephsaffron.github.io/blog/2018-08-02-gen-con-2018/ rel=full-article>Read On &rarr;</a></footer></article><article><header><p class=meta>Feb 16, 2016

She insists that I am asking biased questions when I try to get opinions on how she compares to other babies. Well, this past week, I went to make a reservation at a local Chinese restaurant that we frequent, and this is the conversation that ensued:
Me: Hi, I&rsquo;d like to make a reservation for six adults and one baby.</p><footer><a href=https://josephsaffron.github.io/blog/2013-12-30-unbiased/ rel=full-article>Read On &rarr;</a></footer></article><div class=pagination><a href=/ aria-label=First class=label-pagination><i class="fa fa-angle-double-left fa-lg"></i></a><a href=/ class=label-pagination>1</a>
