The incredible thing about it is that people have built all these amazing actions that you can use to build your CI system in a plug-and-play way! One of these actions that I&rsquo;ve now integrated into this very blog is a hugo deployment action. It now deploys itself as soon as I make a change, which is fantastical!</p><footer><a href=https://josephsaffron.github.io/blog/2021-05-12-blog-now-improved-but-also-completely-the-same/ rel=full-article>Read On &rarr;</a></footer></article><article><header><p class=meta>Apr 22, 2021

I decided to list them out and go through some of them in a bit of detail. What else is there to do during a global pandemic?
Comfort Food Malt and Barley One of our earliest local spots, it&rsquo;s remained one of our absolute favourites. Everything we&rsquo;ve tried there has been fantastic, and the portion sizes are great.</p><footer><a href=https://josephsaffron.github.io/blog/2021-04-22-best-places-weve-found-to-eat-in-kwc-takeout-edition/ rel=full-article>Read On &rarr;</a></footer></article><article><header><p class=meta>Sep 20, 2020

It was an interesting experience, to say the least. I had to think of things to keep them engaged, and I really felt when they made a connection. I also really felt when I had lost them completely - they all had phones. =/ For better or worse, my notes are below:</p><footer><a href=https://josephsaffron.github.io/blog/2020-01-20-take-your-grade-9s-to-work-and-give-them-a-presentation/ rel=full-article>Read On &rarr;</a></footer></article><article><header><p class=meta>Jun 24, 2019

The official scrum guide says that “the sprint retrospective is an opportunity for the team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next sprint”. If you’re just starting out with running retrospectives though, beginning your retrospectives with this goal can quickly devolve to finger pointing and complaining.</p><footer><a href=https://josephsaffron.github.io/blog/2019-06-24-ideas-for-running-retrospectives/ rel=full-article>Read On &rarr;</a></footer></article><article><header><p class=meta>Aug 2, 2018

The last time we went was in 2010, so it&rsquo;s been awhile, and a lot has changed! It would probably be best to start from the beginning of the trip though. We decided to leave on Tuesday afternoon so that we could get a day to relax before the conference, which ended up being a pretty good decision.</p><footer><a href=https://josephsaffron.github.io/blog/2018-08-02-gen-con-2018/ rel=full-article>Read On &rarr;</a></footer></article><article><header><p class=meta>Feb 16, 2016

On Thursday, we went skating with the Grad Cell small group, and she had a blast! She didn&rsquo;t end up skating on her own at all, so we had to take turns holding her up as she walked around the ice.</p><footer><a href=https://josephsaffron.github.io/blog/2016-02-16-winter-experiences/ rel=full-article>Read On &rarr;</a></footer></article><article><header><p class=meta>Dec 30, 2013

She insists that I am asking biased questions when I try to get opinions on how she compares to other babies. Well, this past week, I went to make a reservation at a local Chinese restaurant that we frequent, and this is the conversation that ensued:
Me: Hi, I&rsquo;d like to make a reservation for six adults and one baby.</p><footer><a href=https://josephsaffron.github.io/blog/2013-12-30-unbiased/ rel=full-article>Read On &rarr;</a></footer></article><article><header><p class=meta>Oct 17, 2013

I got about halfway through the course before I nearly broke down in frustration at the lack of basic grammar and editing in the questions and content. I was chatting with a co-worker while I was doing the course, and expressed my anger to her. She told me to “turn your internal grammar/spelling/logic sensor off”. Since there was no off switch for my sensor, I resorted to documenting the atrocities against the English language that I was witnessing as a way of dealing with the fact that I had to read these unedited words.</p><footer><a href=https://josephsaffron.github.io/blog/2013-10-17-grammar-wars/ rel=full-article>Read On &rarr;</a></footer></article><article><header><p class=meta>Aug 13, 2013
