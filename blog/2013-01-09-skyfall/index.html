Rather than issuing a new voucher, he suggested that I keep it since I wasn’t using it that night, since a new voucher would have an expiry of three months.

I think that I began to try to absorb all the information that I could, constantly reading news sites and thirsting for updates and newness. Sadly, most of this information was a transient thing, and by continually moving from tidbit to tidbit, I never gave myself the chance to reflect and digest, which is where learning really takes place. I think in this coming year, I’m going to try to spend more time reflecting, and try to get a better understanding of what I’m supposed to do.
