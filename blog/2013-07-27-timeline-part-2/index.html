<a href="http://him.happyhippos.ca/?p=219" title=Timeline target=_blank rel=noopener>Part 1</a> if you&rsquo;re looking for what happened before.</p><p>3:07 - I park my car illegally.  Midwives reassure me that “they don&rsquo;t ticket at night”.</p><p>3:10 - We get into the labour room.  Wifey&rsquo;s still having some pretty rough contractions (obviously). Baby&rsquo;s not moving much.</p><p>3:35 - Gynecologist stops by, briefly.  She&rsquo;s got crazy red lips, and wifey tells me she looks like a vampire.  Puts on a front cover apron and goggles, but parts of her face are uncovered (will be relevant later).</p><p>4:05 - Gynecologist is back, wants Wifey in a really uncomfortable position.  Thermal light is making her really hot too.  Cold compresses constantly, and contractions are happening this entire time.</p><p>4:06 - My wife pees on the gynecologist.  Oops.  She&rsquo;s not impressed, especially since she wasn&rsquo;t fully covered.  Asks for a catheter to drain the bladder.  That process looks extremely painful.</p><p>4:30 - Contractions are getting more and more spaced out because her body&rsquo;s just tired.  OB wants to try forceps, and to prepare for that, she wants to prescribe an epidural.  We were hoping to avoid that, but it&rsquo;s been a long night.</p><p>4:40 - Bloodwork comes back with a low platelet count, making an epidural impossible.  We&rsquo;ve got mixed feelings about that.</p><p>5:05 - The nurse tells us that we&rsquo;re going to a different room.  Wife and I exchange glances.  The nurse claims it&rsquo;s “cooler and more comfortable.”  We&rsquo;re not five years old, we can figure out where this is going;</p><p>5:08 - We arrive in a sterile looking room that is quite chilly.  Wife asks if it&rsquo;s the C-section room. Nurse replies that there have been natural births here before.  Sigh.  Was hoping to avoid a C-section. She signs a form saying that we&rsquo;ll try forceps and then C-section.</p><p>5:15 -</p><p>5:45 - Anesthesiologist is introduced, and is mid-sentence explaining the procedure.  My wife politely interjects “One second”, and then goes into one of the biggest contractions yet.  She&rsquo;s so considerate!  He never does finish his speech.</p><p>5:49 - First forcep is inserted.  The doctor can&rsquo;t get the second one in though, so she goes for a one forcep turn of the baby&rsquo;s head.</p><p>5:50 - Nurse tells me to look away as the gynecologist performs an
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episiotomy target=_blank rel=noopener>episiotomy</a>.  Her timing is a little off, as by the time she finishes speaking, the procedure&rsquo;s done.  I&rsquo;m still okay though, I don&rsquo;t really get nauseated by blood.</p><p>5:52 - I see the doctor asking people to prepare for a C-section.  I&rsquo;m pretty worried for my wife at this point.  Fortunately, she manages to get the second forcep in and locked, and tells my wife to push with all she&rsquo;s got!</p><p>5:54 - I was a little bit kidding about being okay with blood, as the
<a href=http://www.pregnancy.org/article/what-expect-when-babys-crowning target=_blank rel=noopener>crowning process</a> spurts blood right onto my face.  My inner voice says “eew”, and my outer face says “You&rsquo;re doing great!”</p><p> </p><p>5:56 - BABY!  I cry and tell her it&rsquo;s a girl!  She asks for the time and gasps out “I won!”  Cord is clamped and cut, cord blood is drained, for donation or testing.  Leia&rsquo;s here!  She&rsquo;s taken off for examination and cleaning!  Placenta is birthed, everything&rsquo;s stitched up, skin to skin contact, yay!</p><p>7:00 - We&rsquo;re back in the labouring room.  It&rsquo;s nice to take a breather.  Incredibly, this tiny human being just popped into our family!  I&rsquo;m so exhausted and excited.</p><p>7:30 - I don&rsquo;t want to get a ticket, so I drive my car intending to clean up the mess that we left at our house.  I arrive to an incredibly spotless house, all the garbage and everything taken out, sheets laundered, our old laundry FOLDED; Lillian, Melodie, and Jonathan are incredible!</p><p>I have nothing left to do but head back to the hospital, so I bring along a sleeping bag so I can get some rest.  I spend some time with Leia and mom, and our first visitor arrives while I&rsquo;m passed out on the couch.  PT played the “pastor card” to get into the room outside visiting hours.  Melodie and Jonathan stop by with some delicious food, and a board game.  Mommy tastes sushi for the first time in a loooooooooong time.  Later in the evening, we get a notice that both the Record and CKCO (Kitchener CTV) want to do an interview with people who had a baby on the same day as Prince George was born.  We shrug our shoulders and agree, and wonder aloud if everyone on the floor is getting interviewed.  Apparently, we&rsquo;re the only couple that speak English, and everyone else needs an interpreter, so we&rsquo;re the only ones!  How strange.  They just want to localise the story though, so we think, “Why not?”  It&rsquo;ll be a fun story for Leia.</p><p>Nurses spring into action!  Our room is spotless in no time.  I&rsquo;m amazed at what can be tidied, and Emily&rsquo;s changed and straightened in anticipation for the media visit.  When the hospital&rsquo;s media correspondent comes out to see us, he takes down our names.  When he passes those names to the newspaper/tv studio, they laugh and see the tie in with the Prince and Princess name!  They come and ask us a few questions, and then we&rsquo;re done.</p><p>Later in the evening, we have some more visitors, and then family visitors!  We&rsquo;re both exhausted after, and wake up several times to comfort Leia.  We head off after lunch the next day, then circle back when we realise that we&rsquo;ve forgotten flowers!   After leaving for the second time, we finally make it home, ready to begin a new life as a family of three!  It&rsquo;s been a wild ride, and there has been so much that has happened since.  I&rsquo;ll be sure to post it all up somewhere, and we&rsquo;ve got a ton of photos.  Thanks to everyone for all their gifts and support, and we ask for your prayers that we&rsquo;ll be successful and godly parents.</p><p> </p></div><footer><p class=meta><span class="byline author vcard">Posted by <span class=fn>Joseph Wong</span></span>
