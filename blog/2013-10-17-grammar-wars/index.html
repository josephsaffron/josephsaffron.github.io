I got about halfway through the course before I nearly broke down in frustration at the lack of basic grammar and editing in the questions and content. I was chatting with a co-worker while I was doing the course, and expressed my anger to her. She told me to “turn your internal grammar/spelling/logic sensor off”. Since there was no off switch for my sensor, I resorted to documenting the atrocities against the English language that I was witnessing as a way of dealing with the fact that I had to read these unedited words. Here are some examples of what I found, along with my notes:</p><p>“Head&rsquo;s Up!” - apostrophe not used correctly - statement isn&rsquo;t possessive. Also, this should be a more descriptive title like “There are prerequisites to this section of content”.</p><p>Question 7 - “If the PRB is not worth pursuing do to End of Life” should be “due to”</p><p>Meaning, the PRB was not born from an Incident - sentence fragment. Attach this fragment to the previous sentence.</p><p>According to my co-worker, it&rsquo;s standard practice here at my company to gloss over grammar and spelling errors with the reasoning that “It&rsquo;s internal, it doesn&rsquo;t matter”. This attitude drives me crazy! Are you saying that your employees don&rsquo;t care about seeing professional documentation when it deals with their very employment? Why bother writing job offers or hiring contracts that make sense? They&rsquo;ll only be seen by internal employees! To me, these kinds of things are what differentiates a growing company from a grown-up company.</p><p>Blegh.</p></div></article></main><div class="authorbox clearfix"><div class=authorbox__header><span class=authorbox__name>About Joseph Wong</span></div><div class=authorbox__description>Father of two, software developer, avid reader</div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 Happyhippos.
