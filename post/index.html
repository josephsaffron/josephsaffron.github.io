You drive your car, and roll down your windows, and the people give you candy. The kids sat in the back with their windows rolled down, held open their bags, and got candy deposited in. Strangely, they also tried to hand candy to my wife. It took us awhile before we realised that they probably thought she was a kid!</div></article><article class="list__item post"><header class=list__header><h2 class="list__title post__title"><a href=/blog/2021-05-12-blog-now-improved-but-also-completely-the-same/ rel=bookmark>Blog now improved!

The incredible thing about it is that people have built all these amazing actions that you can use to build your CI system in a plug-and-play way! One of these actions that I&rsquo;ve now integrated into this very blog is a hugo deployment action. It now deploys itself as soon as I make a change, which is fantastical!</div></article><article class="list__item post"><header class=list__header><h2 class="list__title post__title"><a href=/blog/2021-04-22-best-places-weve-found-to-eat-in-kwc-takeout-edition/ rel=bookmark>Best places (we've found) to eat in KWC - Takeout Edition!</a></h2></header><div class="content list__excerpt post__content clearfix">Since we&rsquo;ve been confined to our house for more than a year, we&rsquo;ve done a pretty extensive tour of several restaurants, takeout style. I decided to list them out and go through some of them in a bit of detail. What else is there to do during a global pandemic?
Comfort Food Malt and Barley One of our earliest local spots, it&rsquo;s remained one of our absolute favourites. Everything we&rsquo;ve tried there has been fantastic, and the portion sizes are great.</div></article><article class="list__item post"><header class=list__header><h2 class="list__title post__title"><a href=/blog/2020-01-20-take-your-grade-9s-to-work-and-give-them-a-presentation/ rel=bookmark>Take your Grade 9s to work and give them a presentation</a></h2></header><div class="content list__excerpt post__content clearfix">For some reason, I decided to volunteer to give a talk about software development to some Grade 9s. It was an interesting experience, to say the least. I had to think of things to keep them engaged, and I really felt when they made a connection. I also really felt when I had lost them completely - they all had phones. =/ For better or worse, my notes are below:</div></article></main><div class=pagination><span class="pagination__item pagination__item--current">1/4</span>
