Since we've been confined to our house for more than a year, we've done a pretty extensive tour of several restaurants, takeout style. I decided to list them out and go through some of them in a bit of detail.  What else is there to do during a global pandemic?

**Comfort Food**
[Malt and Barley](https://www.maltandbarley.ca/menus.html)
One of our earliest local spots, it's remained one of our absolute favourites. Everything we've tried there has been fantastic, and the portion sizes are great.  It helps that it's an incredibly short walk to our house, and we've always had good experiences there. Standouts include anything schnitzel (sandwich, meal, whatever, they're all crispy and succulent, not dry), fish and chips, and the newfie fries.

**Asian**
[Goen](https://goenjapaneserestaurant.squarespace.com/)
All-you-can-eat sushi is something that you just can't get via takeout, but Goen comes incredibly close for the price to quality/quantity ratio. We've gotten sushi platters from various restaurants around town as deals have come up, but none have come close to the tasty sushi that you can find at Goen Japanese restaurant. Get the platter or the dinners, and you won't be disappointed!

[Anokhi Restaurant](https://www.skipthedishes.com/anokhi-gateway-park-drive)
If you like the spicy meatball (without the meatball), this is the restaurant for you. Delicious and flavourful curry, naan that our kids just cannot get enough of, and even some fusion indo-chinese dishes that we haven't been able to find anywhere else! Enjoy these dishes, but watch out for the next morning!

[Bistro 519 ( Wasabi )](https://wusa.ca/bistro519)
If you want value, it's hard to beat this student-association run restaurant! Gigantic portions, and delicious food, and for some reason they include a double portion of fries with every meal order. The fries are GOOD too! We had the baos, and some rolls for the kids, and we'll definitely order again. Word of warning, if you're planning to feed these to people with a low spicy tolerance (like my children), make sure you ask for sauce on the side!

**Dessert and Drinks**  
[Tsujiri](https://www.tsujiri.ca/collections/all)
Most definitely on the pricy side, but if you like asian desserts, their mochis are unparalleled. Strong matcha flavours, and tender, moist mochi, you will not find a more delicious (and expensive!) dessert in town. Their cheesecakes are to die for, and just writing about them now makes me crave some.


This pandemic has been hard for a lot of people, and I just wanted to note that if anyone wants to play a board game over zoom, using tabletop simulator or boardgamearena, or even just to chat, feel free to hit me up! We're all looking forward to the end of this struggle, and I know I've had it a lot easier than many other people, so if I can help in any way, don't hesitate to reach out.
