If you haven't heard, github has released a really cool feature called github actions, letting you do continuous integration right within github. The incredible thing about it is that people have built all these amazing actions that you can use to build your CI system in a plug-and-play way!
One of these actions that I've now integrated into this very blog is a [hugo deployment action](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-hugo). It now deploys itself as soon as I make a change, which is fantastical!
All that work is done, but what that should mean is that you, my dear readers, should see absolutely no difference whatsoever.  Enjoy!
