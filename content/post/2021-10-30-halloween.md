So today was the day before halloween, and one of the things that we did with the kids was a drive through trick-or-treat. You drive your car, and roll down your windows, and the people give you candy. The kids sat in the back with their windows rolled down, held open their bags, and got candy deposited in. Strangely, they also tried to hand candy to my wife. It took us awhile before we realised that they probably thought she was a kid! I'll leave this for my dear readers to be the judge:
