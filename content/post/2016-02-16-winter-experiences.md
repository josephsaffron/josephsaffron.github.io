Part of being a parent is being able to share the things that you find joy in doing, and this past week I got a chance to help my daughter discover the wonders of winter. On Thursday, we went skating with the [Grad Cell](http://www.simplychurch.ca/get-involved/g-r-a-d-cell-group/) small group, and she had a blast!  She didn't end up skating on her own at all, so we had to take turns holding her up as she walked around the ice. Although she was hesitant at first, she eventually got used to the sensation, and was walk/skating all over the rink.

The other thing we got to do was some tobogganing on Family Day. <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20160215_112720_hdr-1024x576.jpg" alt="IMG_20160215_112720_hdr" width="640" height="360" />

With some help from friends, we made it up the hill several times, and she got to enjoy what I think is the best part about living in Canada. =)<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-266" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20160215_112428-e1455598461752-576x1024.jpg" alt="IMG_20160215_112428" width="576" height="1024" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20160215_112428-e1455598461752-576x1024.jpg 576w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20160215_112428-e1455598461752-169x300.jpg 169w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20160215_112428-e1455598461752-768x1365.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" />

It was an insanely big hill for her, and I'm really proud that she wasn't scared at all!  
All in all, we had tons of fun!
