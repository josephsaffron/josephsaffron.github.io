I've been having an ongoing dispute with my wife about how cute our daughter is. She insists that I am asking biased questions when I try to get opinions on how she compares to other babies. Well, this past week, I went to make a reservation at a local Chinese restaurant that we frequent, and this is the conversation that ensued:

Me: Hi, I'd like to make a reservation for six adults and one baby.
  
Restaurant: What time?
  
Me: 6:30pm.
  
Restaurant: That's six adults and one baby?
  
Me: Yep!
  
Restaurant: Is it the cutest baby in the world?
  
Me: Yep! =)

So take that, wife!
